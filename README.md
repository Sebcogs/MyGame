# MyGame
A simple text-based RPG used for me to develop and practice my C++.  The game excecutable to be run from console.

So far this works pretty  well but isn't finished.  Lots of features I want to add still and maybe develop a GUI.
It hasn't been tested properly for invalid user input.

## To Do:
- [ ] Refactor the Hero creation using creational patterns
- [ ] Refactor the item classes for composite patterns or to make it more efficient
- [ ] Develop the combat order from initiative
- [ ] Test for invalid user entry handling
- [ ] Start adding more features like magic, skills, etc
- [ ] Make the GameMap class refactored and make more maps
....

This is using D&D core mechanics and some of the code was modified from Objects First with Java textbook.
