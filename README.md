# MyGame
A simple text-based RPG used for me to develop and practice my C++.  The game excecutable to be run from console.  I have only tested this on Linux.

So far this works pretty  well but isn't finished.  Lots of features I want to add still and maybe develop a GUI.
This includes some basic parser classes to interpret user commands.  
There are several text files that contain lists of items, monsters and such that are accessed by the game.
The complier command text files includes the linux command to compile the game.  Run it in the main-code folder.

## Recent updates include:
- [x] Use of creational patterns for character creation
- [x] Added features like basic magic
- [x] Added character conditions that will affect their behaviour 
- [x] Class diagrams and game design files to help manage the game and class behaviour
## To Do:
- [ ] Refactor the item classes for composite patterns or to make it more efficient
- [ ] Start adding more features like skills, and special abilities
- [ ] Make the GameMap class refactored and add more maps

This is using D&D 3.5edition core mechanics and some of the code was modified from Objects First with Java textbook.
